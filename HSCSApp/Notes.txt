BUGS TO FIX:





PLAN:




APPLICATION FLOW:
-Customer go to the website
-Then if He/She click "Get A Quote" cta:
-|-He/She will be redirected to Services Page, with a quotation form displayed.
-Quotation Per service
-|-Logic:
-|--If CTA get a quote was click then the Icon Service will be the quote
-|--If Service was click the Id will be the base of the Icon and the service selection will also be service clicked and it can't be change
Solution: serviceIcon and selectedService variable


BACKEND FLOW:
-Create a model first



IMPORTANT NOTES:
-If si Client nag click sang service, dapat ang logo kag ang name ma lain man, then ang unod sang form ma lain man.
